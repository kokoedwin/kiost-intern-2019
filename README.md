# Research Intern at KIOST 

I was selected as one of 21 interns from 18 different countries to participate in the UST Global Internship Program by the University of Science and Technology. I did my research intern at the Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology(KIOST) for Marine Security and Safety Research Center. The internship involved the development of methods for object detection and classification in the sea from image satellite data.

Due to confidentiality reasons, I can't share any code and data in publicâ€”every resource owned by the Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology. However, I can share the research report what I have done for two months.
